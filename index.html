    <p>Hello! This is a non-profit blog set up by me, Ed.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>I enjoy coding and am currently learning HTML. Being an operating system enthusiast, my poor old Dell Inspiron 3505 has been through a tought time with me bricking it multiple times in an attempt to install Arch Linux on it.</p>
    <br>
    <p>This blog is mainly in place just so I can tell the community about different coding opportunities I have had and what I will do in the future in regards to technology.</p>
    <br>
    <p> It may seem somewhat silly, but this is called OmniClip Blogs becuase of the game Universal Paperclips (which can be found at https://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/). I named my virtual paperclip manufacturing monopoly 'OmniClip Industries', and I am continuing using it because of the catchiness of the title.</p>
